## Project Overview
This project analyzes a binomial probability distribution using data from a national study that found 44.7% of college students have used Wikipedia as a source in at least one term paper. The analysis includes calculating the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for a sample of 31 students and visualizing these distributions.

## Dataset Information
Sample Size (n): 31 students
Probability of Success (p): 0.447 (students using Wikipedia)
## Key Components
PMF (Probability Mass Function): This function describes the likelihood of observing a specific number of successes (students using Wikipedia) in the sample.
CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function): This function shows the probability of observing a number of successes less than or equal to a certain value.
Visualizations: The project includes visualizations for both the PMF and CDF using ggplot2 in R.
